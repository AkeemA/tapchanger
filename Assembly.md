Insert the heat-set inserts, they need to be flush with the surface and reasonably accurate, focus on getting the angle right.
There is an optional *-thruholes* version that allows to slightly thread in a screw from the back to make the angle perfect.
If the toolhead does not roll freely, you might need to redo this.

Screw in the bearings, using 8-10 mm scews and washers.



# The toolhead

Print the back plate.
Use a 3mm drill bit on slow speed to clear out any loose overhangs from the rod holes.

# The dock

Print the parts. 

Press fit a magnet into the pivot.
Attach it to the dock using m3x12 with thread removed from the tips.

Insert a heatset insert into the ozze pad. Then fill the rest with a high temp silicone and let it cure. Screw into place with an m3x8, add a small piece of spring under it to allow some adjustment.
