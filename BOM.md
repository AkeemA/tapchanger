## BOM

### Frame

The front needs to be extended 20 mm forward, and optinally top can be extended 40-60 mm up to give more vertical space.
For a 350 build, I'm using:
Front:
 * 20x20 extrusions: 2x533 + 3x470.
 * Two right angles to mount the center extrusion.
Top:
 * 20x40 extrusion 2x510mm + 2x470mm

### Shuttle
 * 8x M3 5mm BHSC for the [shuttle assembly](assembly.md).
 * 2x M3x6 countersunk steel screws (must be magnetic).
 * 1x 6x3mm round magnet for the carriage plug.
 
### Each Toolhead
 * A Tap kit + a Canbus enabled Stealthburner toolhead of your choice
 * 2x 5x2 round magnet, can use a 6x3mm magnet, but need to mod the bottom stealthburner screw holes to match.
 * **5amps** USB chargning cable, look for the ones supporting 100w, 1m, used for CANbus. Feel free to use other cables, I just like them being slim and thin.

### Each Dock
 * 2x M3x12 screws with thread dremeled off for the last 3 mm
 * 1x 6x3 round magnet
 * 3x m3x12, 1x m3x10
 * Some silicone for the nozzle pad
 * a small piece of spring to hold up the nozzle pad.
 
### Distribution board
 * Prototyping board ~100mm x 4 holes
 * 6x KF128 2.54mm pitch 4pin PCB screw Terminal block, rated for 6-10amps.
 * 2x m3x12, 2x heatset inserts
