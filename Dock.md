## Mounting beam

The toolheads are docked on a 2020 extrusion across the front. There is no space to mount that directly inside the pront volume, since it interferes with XY idlers. This also allows moving the toolheads 15mm more out of the way.

My approach was to attach a square of 2020 extrusions all around the door frame and mount the cross beam to that. Feel free to experiment here.


## The dock

Print the part, thread in two 10mm steel screws into the holes. Stainless does not work as they need to be magnetic and will hold the docked hotend in place.

Mount on the profile.
