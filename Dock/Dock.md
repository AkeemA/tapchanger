# The dock

# Nozzle pad

Print the nozzle pad mold. Put on some mold release, just rubbing with a birthday candle works well. 

Cut a 35mm piece of springsteel and mold the silicone pad on one end.
The mount is designed so that the springsteel slightly curves downwards, slightly bend it if not so.

## Mounting beam

The toolheads are docked on a 2020 extrusion across the front. There is no space to mount that directly inside the pront volume, since it interferes with XY idlers. This also allows moving the toolheads 15mm more out of the way.

My approach was to attach a square of 2020 extrusions all around the door frame and mount the cross beam to that. Feel free to experiment here.
