# Print guide

The plastic parts are bearing quite some load, so printing them accurately key to a succeessful setup.

### Plastic

ASA is the preferred filament right now, providing generally better rigidity than ABS, especially when kept under load. I have had good success with Prusament ASA.

PC-ABS is an option, drop me a line if you have success with that.

### Parameters

Use usual [Voron print settings](https://docs.vorondesign.com/sourcing.html#print-settings), plus:

 - 80% infill.
 - Supports on bed plate only.
 - (optional) Enable ironing.
 - support interface layers: 2
 - support interface spacing: 0.12
 - I'm printing with organic suppots, but anythign goes

### Cleanup

You will need to clean up some supports.  Flush cut pliers will get them removed just fine.

Optionally can print with PETG or soluable supports, but I would not bother.
