# Voron TapChanger
A toolchanger system For [Voron 2](https://github.com/VoronDesign/Voron-2) based on the Tap bed probe.
Aimed to use as much of the original [Stealthburner](https://github.com/VoronDesign/Voron-Stealthburner) and [Tap](https://github.com/VoronDesign/Voron-Tap) parts as possible.
With the same zero offset bed probing and excellent rigidity as Tap.
