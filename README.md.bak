# TapChanger for Voron
A toolchanger system For [Voron 2](https://github.com/VoronDesign/Voron-2) based on the [Tap](https://github.com/VoronDesign/Voron-Tap) bed probe.

This is independant effort, not affiliated with the Voron team. Use at your own risk.

## Features
* Drop in compatibe with [Stealthburner](https://github.com/VoronDesign/Voron-Stealthburner) hotends.
* Adaptable from [Tap](https://github.com/VoronDesign/Voron-Tap) with mostly just printed parts.
* Same rigidity and probe accuracy as regular Tap.
* No servos, no wires on the shuttle, recommended to use with a Canbus toolhead board for less wires, but anything goes.
* Uses the Tap sensor to verify successful dropoffs and pickups.

## Design

Toolheads are docked in an extra extrusion at the front of the printer. The toolhead is rested on a dock and as the shuttle moves down toolhead slides off the Tap rail.

Cudos for inspiration to [WP-Daksh](https://github.com/ankurv2k6/wp-daksh-toolchanger) and the Voron India discord.

The Tap probe is almost working as a toolchanger out of the box, the main issue is that a naked linear carriage is prone to loosing balls.
This is solved by pushing in a supporting TPU plug while the shuttle is traveling between the tools.

In a normal Tap setup, the plug would need to come from above the rail and no room for it there. So the MGN9 rail is flipped around - the carriage is on the shuttle side and the rail is on the toolhead side, allowing the plug to sit below the Tap rail in the dock.

## BOM

Shuttle:
 * 8x M3 5mm slotted pan head screws for the [shuttle assembly](assembly.md), look [like this](https://accu-components.com/us/pan-head-screws/7119-SFP-M3-5-A4).
 * 2x M3x6 countersunk steel screws
 * 2x 5x2mm round magnets for the carriage plug. Or 6x3.
 
Each Toolhead:
 * A Tap kit + a Stealthburner toolhead of your choice
 * 2x 5x2 round magnet, can use a 6mm magnet, but need to mod the bottom stealthburner screw holes to match.
 * 2x M3x12 screws with thread dremeled off for the last 3 mm
 * **5amps** USB chargning cable, 1m, used for CANbus.

Each Dock:
 * 2x m3x12 steel screws - need to be magnetic
 * 2x m3x6 countersunk steel scews - need to be magnetic, if you get a Tap kit for each toolheand, will be able to reuse them here.
 * 2x m3x16, 1x m3x12, 1x m3x10, 2x heatset insert
 * Some 1mm silicone sheet, can reuse cooking gloves or bakery cups
 
Distribution board:
<<<<<<< HEAD
 * Prototyping board ~100mm x 4 holes
 * 6x KF128 2.54mm pitch 4pin PCB screw Terminal block, rated for 6-10amps.
 * 2x m3x12, 2x heatset inserts

# Work site here

This is **work in progress**, nothing has been tested yet. 

Done:
* The main shuttle + Stealthburner mount
* The dock works

WIP: 
* Put on a printer
* Make the distribution board.
* Test, fix, repeat
