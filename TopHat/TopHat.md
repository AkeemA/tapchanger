# Tophat to encose the umbilicals.

Adds a 20cm extra clearance for umbilicals. Reuses the top plate.

Theese are some big pieces to print from ABS:

- the **beams are 0.5% longer** and have bigger screw holes and support 0.5-1.5% shrinkage
- add mouse ears or there is high chance the beams will peel off

It just sits on top of the frame with alignment pins dropping down into the extrusion slots
