# The Shuttle

Print one copy of the plug and glue the magnet into place.
I used 82 hardness TPU, but mostly anything should work. Possibly even regular ABS.

The shuttle needs to be printed with supports. And the screws are partially covered by the rail carriages.

First insert all the screws into the part. 

Then screw in the MGN9 carriage. 

Then attach your belts and locate the shuttle over the main carriage.

Use a ball end allen key inserted at a slight angle to screw in the MGN12 carriage.

The X endstop is optional.

# The toolhead

Make a normal Stealthburner toolhead. Print the custom back plate and attach the rail to it.
Insert the magnet holders and keep them loose for now.

It helps to dremel the rail end round to help with alignment:

The final assmeblt looks like this:

# The dock

Print the parts. 

Press fit a magnet into the pivot.
Attach it to the dock using m3x12 with thread removed from the tips.

Insert a heatset insert into the ozze pad. Then fill the rest with a high temp silicone and let it cure. Screw into place with an m3x8, add a small piece of spring under it to allow some adjustment.
