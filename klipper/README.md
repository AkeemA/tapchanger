# Klipper setup

## Overview

TapChanger is primarily a hardware project. The config here is just the setup I'm using.
Which should be a reasonable starting point.

Long term I'm looking to upstream the changes in klipper and Klipper_ToolChanger where reasonable.

## Installing

- install [ToolChanger extension](https://github.com/TypQxQ/Klipper_ToolChanger)
- copy the klippy contents to  ${KLIPPER_PATH}/klippy/
- use the config as a template for your own config
